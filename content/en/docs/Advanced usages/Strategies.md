  How to design search strategies?

### Designing your own search strategy

#### Using selectors

To design your own strategy using `Search.intVarSearch`, you simply have to implement
your own variable and value selectors:

```java
public static IntStrategy intVarSearch(VariableSelector<IntVar> varSelector,
                                    IntValueSelector valSelector,
                                    IntVar... vars)
```

For instance, to select the first non instantiated variable and assign it to its lower bound:

```java
Solver s = model.getSolver();
s.setSearch(intVarSearch(
        // variable selector
        (VariableSelector<IntVar>) variables -> {
            for(IntVar v:variables){
                if(!v.isInstantiated()){
                    return v;
                }
            }
            return null;
        },
        // value selector
        (IntValueSelector) var -> var.getLB(),
        // variables to branch on
        x, y
));
```

**NOTE**: When all variables are instantiated, a `VariableSelector` must return `null`.

#### From scratch

You can design your own strategy by creating `Decision` objects directly as follows:

```java
s.setSearch(new AbstractStrategy<IntVar>(x,y) {
    // enables to recycle decision objects (good practice)
    PoolManager<IntDecision> pool = new PoolManager();
    @Override
    public Decision getDecision() {
        IntDecision d = pool.getE();
        if(d==null) d = new IntDecision(pool);
        IntVar next = null;
        for(IntVar v:vars){
            if(!v.isInstantiated()){
                next = v; break;
            }
        }
        if(next == null){
            return null;
        }else {
            // next decision is assigning nextVar to its lower bound
            d.set(next,next.getLB(), DecisionOperator.int_eq);
            return d;
        }
    }
});
```

### Making a decision greedy

You can make a decision non-refutable by using `decision.setRefutable(false)` inside your 

To make an entire search strategy greedy, use:

```java
Solver s = model.getSolver();
s.setSearch(greedySearch(inputOrderLBSearch(x,y,z)));
```



### Large Neighborhood Search (LNS)


##### Defining its own neighborhoods

One can define its own neighbor by extending the abstract class `INeighbor`.
It forces to implements the following methods:

```java
void recordSolution()
// Action to perform on a solution. 
// Typically, storing the current variablesâ€™ value.
```
```java
void fixSomeVariables()
// Fix some variables to their value in the last solution.
```
```java
void restrictLess()
// Relax the number of variables fixed. 
// Called when no solution was found during a LNS run 
// (i.e., trapped into a local optimum).
```

```java
boolean isSearchComplete()`
// Indicates whether the neighbor is complete, that is, can end.
```
