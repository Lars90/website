  Choco-solver documentation takes on a new dimension.
---

We are pleased to announce that the Choco-solver site is getting a fresh start. We wish to gather under the same banner the technical documentation and the tutorials.

For this, we chose [Hugo, a static site generator](https://gohugo.io/) and [Docsy, a pretty Hugo theme](https://www.docsy.dev/). 

The update of the documentation is just starting, you can check the status, report errors or contribute by going to the [Documentation](/docs/) page.

We will also transfer the tutorials to a separate page as soon as possible.

The motivated team !
