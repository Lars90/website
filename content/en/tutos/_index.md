This section is where the tutorials for Choco-solver lives - all the information you need to take charge of the library. 

Note that it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the theoretical concepts of constraint-programming. The current material is meant to help the reader to learn the basics of Choco-solver {{< param "choco_version" >}}, not constraint-programming itself.

General documentation on constraint-programming may be found at:
-   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming)
-   [Handbook of Constraint
    Programming](http://store.elsevier.com/Handbook-of-Constraint-Programming/isbn-9780444527264/)
-   [Hakan's
     advices](http://cp2013.a4cp.org/sites/default/files/uploads/cpsolvers2013.Hakan_.pdf)
-   [Bartakâ€™s courses](http://ktiml.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/constraints/index.html)
-   [MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modeling-discrete-optimization)

In case the reader is completely new to the domain of constraint-programming, it is highly recommended to attend training courses.
