[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golomb_ruler) told us that:

> A **Golomb ruler** is a set of marks at integer positions along an
> imaginary ruler such that no two pairs of marks are the same distance
> apart. The number of marks on the ruler is its order, and the largest
> distance between two of its marks is its length. The objective is to
> find optimal (minimum length) or near optimal rulers. Translation and
> reflection of a Golomb ruler are considered trivial, so the smallest
> mark is customarily put at 0 and the next mark at the smaller of its
> two possible values.
