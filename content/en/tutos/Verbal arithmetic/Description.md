A **verbal arithmetic** is a mathematical equation among unknown
numbers, whose digits are represented by letters (see
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic) for more
details).

Input data
----------

The equation we consider here is:

        S E N D
	+   M O R E
	-----------
	= M O N E Y

A value has to be assigned to each letter in such a way that the
equation is satisfied. Note that:

-   each letter corresponds to a digit,
-   a word cannot start with Ã  0,
-   no two letters are assigned to the same digit.
